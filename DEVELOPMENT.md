# Development

---
 - **4/24/20** Implemented basic grid for UI
    - Issues with cinder::surface means can't crop images the way is needed. I will have to change my approach and instead implement a numbers version of the puzzle (with user-defined grid size) and maybe a default image mode
    - Need to attach text to the boxes
    
 - **4/25/20** Need to complete the following:
    - [x] draw text on the grid
    - [x] write GameBoard class and related functions
    - [x] write tests for GameBoard class
    
 - **4/26/20** Need to complete the following:
    - [x] draw the shuffled board on ui
    - [x] make the game responsive to clicks
    - [ ] determine if player has won
